# Repository: WTB

## Description:
The WTB repository was created as a learning project to understand how to set up and utilize an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) using Entity Framework, as well as to learn the process of setting up CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) using Docker and Azure hosting.

## ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):
ORM is a programming technique that enables developers to interact with relational databases using object-oriented paradigms. It simplifies data access by providing a mapping between the relational database tables and the corresponding objects in the programming language. In the context of the WTB repository, Entity Framework (EF) was used as the ORM framework.

Entity Framework allows developers to define database entities as classes and provides mechanisms for querying and manipulating the database using familiar object-oriented concepts. It abstracts the underlying SQL queries and database interactions, making it easier to work with databases and reducing the need for manual SQL coding.

## CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):
CI/CD is a software development practice that involves automating the processes of integrating code changes, building the application, running tests, and deploying it to production environments.

### Continuous Integration (CI) 
refers to the practice of frequently merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. Automated build systems are used to compile the code, run tests, and provide feedback on any issues that arise. The goal is to identify and address problems early in the development cycle to ensure code stability and collaboration among team members.

### Continuous Deployment / Continous Development(CD) 
takes CI a step further by automatically deploying the application to production or staging environments after passing the CI tests. In the case of the WTB repository, Docker and Azure hosting were employed to facilitate the CD process.

Docker is a containerization platform that allows applications to be packaged into lightweight, isolated containers. It simplifies the deployment process by ensuring that the application and its dependencies are consistent across different environments.

Azure hosting refers to the deployment of the application to the Azure cloud platform, which provides scalable infrastructure and services for hosting applications. Azure allows for easy integration with CI/CD pipelines and provides robust tools for managing application deployments and scaling.

The WTB repository was created to learn the setup and usage of ORM using Entity Framework, as well as to gain knowledge about setting up CI/CD pipelines using Docker and Azure hosting. Through this project, the developer aimed to enhance their understanding of efficient database interactions and automated deployment processes, which are crucial aspects of modern software development.
